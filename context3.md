> This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
  <analysis>
  I'll analyze the conversation chronologically, focusing on the user's requests, my approaches, and key technical details:

  1. Initial Tapered Curve Design Request:
     - User asked to read tapered_curve.md and design using tapered curves for connections.
     - I examined the existing mindmap renderer implementation to understand the current connection drawing.
     - I designed a new approach that keeps the current curve structure but adds tapered effect using filled paths.
     - Proposed significant changes to how curves are rendered, adding new style parameters and helper functions.
     - Explained algorithm details for creating tapered connections with proper control points.

  2. Connection Point Direction Discussion:
     - User pointed out ConnectionPoint already has a direction property.
     - We discussed simplifying the approach by using the existing direction property.
     - Agreed to only take into account the direction at each end of the connection.
     - Simplified the approach to calculating perpendicular offsets based on the connection direction.

  3. Implementation of Tapered Connections:
     - Added new style parameters: connectionTapered, connectionStartWidth, connectionEndWidth, connectionGradient.
     - Implemented helper functions: _calculateBezierControlPoints, _calculatePerpendicularOffsets.
     - Created _drawTaperedConnection method for creating filled path-based connections.
     - Modified _drawConnection to use tapered connections when enabled.
     - Updated createDefs to support gradients for connections.
     - Modified all style presets to include tapered connection options.

  4. Level-specific Tapered Connections Request:
     - User requested defining tapered connection properties with widths gradually decreasing for deeper levels.
     - Asked to use normal connections in default level style for each preset.
     - I started creating a todo list to systematically update each preset with level-specific settings.

  Key files examined and modified include:
  - /home/tigra/PycharmProjects/mindmap-exporter/renderer/tapered_curve.md
  - /home/tigra/PycharmProjects/mindmap-exporter/renderer/mindmap-renderer.js
  - /home/tigra/PycharmProjects/mindmap-exporter/style/style-configuration.js
  - /home/tigra/PycharmProjects/mindmap-exporter/style/style-presets.js
  - /home/tigra/PycharmProjects/mindmap-exporter/layout/connection-point.js
  - /home/tigra/PycharmProjects/mindmap-exporter/layout/vertical-layout.js

  The current task is to update each style preset with level-specific tapered connection properties that gradually decrease in width for deeper hierarchy levels, while ensuring the default style for each preset 
  uses normal (non-tapered) connections.
  </analysis>

  <summary>
  1. Primary Request and Intent:
     The user requested implementing tapered curve connections in the mindmap visualization system. The primary requests were:
     
     - Design a tapered curve approach for connections, based on the information in `tapered_curve.md`
     - Keep the basic structure of the existing curves but add tapered effect with filled paths
     - Use the existing ConnectionPoint direction property without adding additional properties
     - Implement level-specific tapered connection properties with widths that gradually decrease for deeper levels
     - Use normal (non-tapered) connections in the default style for each preset

  2. Key Technical Concepts:
     - SVG Path Generation: Using filled paths instead of stroked paths for connections
     - Tapered Curves: Technique to create varying-width connections using filled SVG paths
     - Bezier Curves: Mathematical curves used for smooth connection paths
     - Connection Points: Objects that define positions where connections attach to nodes
     - Perpendicular Offsets: Calculation of points perpendicular to the curve direction
     - Style Inheritance: Hierarchical application of styles based on node level
     - SVG Gradients: Optional visual enhancement for tapered connections
     - CSS Color Manipulation: Lightening/darkening colors for gradients
     - MVC Architecture: Maintaining separation between model, view, and controller

  3. Files and Code Sections:
     - `/home/tigra/PycharmProjects/mindmap-exporter/style/style-configuration.js`
       - Added new tapered connection style parameters to the StyleConfiguration class
       ```javascript
       // Tapered connection options
       this.connectionTapered = options.connectionTapered !== undefined ? options.connectionTapered : false;
       this.connectionStartWidth = options.connectionStartWidth || 8;
       this.connectionEndWidth = options.connectionEndWidth || 2;
       this.connectionGradient = options.connectionGradient !== undefined ? options.connectionGradient : false;
       ```
       - These parameters control whether connections are tapered, their start/end widths, and whether gradients are used

     - `/home/tigra/PycharmProjects/mindmap-exporter/renderer/mindmap-renderer.js`
       - Added helper function to calculate Bezier control points for the curve centerline
       ```javascript
       _calculateBezierControlPoints(startPoint, endPoint) {
         const isVerticalLayout = startPoint.direction === 'bottom' || startPoint.direction === 'top';
         if (isVerticalLayout) {
           const dy = endPoint.y - startPoint.y;
           return [
             startPoint.x, startPoint.y + dy * 0.4,
             endPoint.x, startPoint.y + dy * 0.6
           ];
         } else {
           const dx = endPoint.x - startPoint.x;
           return [
             startPoint.x + dx * 0.4, startPoint.y,
             startPoint.x + dx * 0.6, endPoint.y
           ];
         }
       }
       ```

       - Added function to calculate perpendicular offsets based on connection direction
       ```javascript
       _calculatePerpendicularOffsets(point, width) {
         switch (point.direction) {
           case 'top':
             return [point.x - width/2, point.y, point.x + width/2, point.y];
           case 'bottom':
             return [point.x + width/2, point.y, point.x - width/2, point.y];
           case 'left':
             return [point.x, point.y - width/2, point.x, point.y + width/2];
           case 'right':
             return [point.x, point.y + width/2, point.x, point.y - width/2];
           default:
             return [point.x - width/2, point.y, point.x + width/2, point.y];
         }
       }
       ```

       - Implemented _drawTaperedConnection method that creates a filled path for tapered connections
       ```javascript
       _drawTaperedConnection(parent, child, parentStyle, childStyle, startPoint, endPoint) {
         const startWidth = parentStyle.connectionStartWidth || 8;
         const endWidth = parentStyle.connectionEndWidth || 2;
         
         const [cp1x, cp1y, cp2x, cp2y] = this._calculateBezierControlPoints(startPoint, endPoint);
         
         const [startTopX, startTopY, startBottomX, startBottomY] = 
           this._calculatePerpendicularOffsets(startPoint, startWidth);
         
         const [endTopX, endTopY, endBottomX, endBottomY] = 
           this._calculatePerpendicularOffsets(endPoint, endWidth);
         
         const path = `M ${startTopX} ${startTopY}
                       C ${cp1x + (startTopX - startPoint.x)} ${cp1y + (startTopY - startPoint.y)},
                         ${cp2x + (endTopX - endPoint.x)} ${cp2y + (endTopY - endPoint.y)},
                         ${endTopX} ${endTopY}
                       L ${endBottomX} ${endBottomY}
                       C ${cp2x + (endBottomX - endPoint.x)} ${cp2y + (endBottomY - endPoint.y)},
                         ${cp1x + (startBottomX - startPoint.x)} ${cp1y + (startBottomY - startPoint.y)},
                         ${startBottomX} ${startBottomY}
                       Z`;
         
         let fill = connectionColor;
         if (parentStyle.connectionGradient) {
           // Implementation for gradient fill
         }
         
         return `<path d="${path}" fill="${fill}" />`;
       }
       ```

       - Modified _drawConnection to support both tapered and normal connections
       ```javascript
       _drawConnection(parent, child) {
         // Get styles and connection points
         
         // Check if tapered connections are enabled
         const useTapered = parentStyle.connectionTapered || false;
         
         if (useTapered) {
           return this._drawTaperedConnection(parent, child, parentStyle, childStyle, startPoint, endPoint);
         }
         
         // Original stroke-based connection code
       }
       ```

       - Enhanced createDefs to support gradients for tapered connections
       ```javascript
       // Create connection gradients if tapered connections are enabled
       if (levelStyle && levelStyle.connectionTapered && levelStyle.connectionGradient && levelStyle.connectionColor) {
         const baseColor = levelStyle.connectionColor;
         const lightColor = this._lightenColor(baseColor, 20);
         const darkColor = this._darkenColor(baseColor, 10);
         
         defs += this._createGradient(`level${i}ConnectionGradient`, lightColor, darkColor);
       }
       ```

     - `/home/tigra/PycharmProjects/mindmap-exporter/style/style-presets.js`
       - Updated all style presets with tapered connection settings, for example:
       ```javascript
       defaultStyle: {
         // Other style properties
         connectionTapered: true,
         connectionStartWidth: 8,
         connectionEndWidth: 2,
         connectionGradient: true
       }
       ```
       - Each preset received custom connection settings appropriate to its style theme

  4. Problem Solving:
     - Connection Direction Handling: Used the existing ConnectionPoint direction property to determine how to calculate perpendicular offsets, simplifying the implementation.
     - Path Generation: Created a complex algorithm for generating the tapered path with proper control points and direction handling.
     - Style Organization: Implemented a clear approach to style parameterization that integrates with the existing style system.
     - Gradient Support: Added support for gradients in tapered connections while maintaining backward compatibility.
     - Preset Customization: Created unique tapered connection settings for each preset that match its visual theme.

  5. Pending Tasks:
     - Update default style preset with level-specific tapered connections
     - Update corporate style preset with level-specific tapered connections
     - Update vibrant style preset with level-specific tapered connections
     - Update pastel style preset with level-specific tapered connections
     - Update monochrome style preset with level-specific tapered connections
     - Update nature style preset with level-specific tapered connections
     - Update tech style preset with level-specific tapered connections
     - Update retro style preset with level-specific tapered connections
     - Update minimal style preset with level-specific tapered connections
     - Update creative style preset with level-specific tapered connections
     - Ensure defaultStyle for each preset uses normal connections

  6. Current Work:
     The current work focuses on implementing level-specific tapered connection properties for each style preset. This involves:
     
     - Adding `connectionTapered`, `connectionStartWidth`, `connectionEndWidth`, and `connectionGradient` properties to each level style
     - Configuring these properties to create a gradual decrease in connection width as the hierarchy gets deeper
     - Ensuring the default style for each preset uses normal (non-tapered) connections
     
     I had just started creating a todo list to systematically update each preset when the summary request was made. The first preset to be updated was going to be the default style preset.

  7. Optional Next Step:
     The next step is to implement level-specific tapered connection properties for the default style preset, following the pattern:
     
     ```javascript
     levelStyles: {
       1: {
         // Existing properties
         connectionTapered: true,
         connectionStartWidth: 10,  // Thickest for root level
         connectionEndWidth: 3,
         connectionGradient: true
       },
       2: {
         // Existing properties
         connectionTapered: true,
         connectionStartWidth: 8,
         connectionEndWidth: 2.5,
         connectionGradient: true
       },
       // And so on with decreasing widths
     },
     defaultStyle: {
       // Existing properties
       connectionTapered: false  // Normal connections in default style
     }
     ```
     
     This approach will create a visual hierarchy where connections gradually become thinner as you move deeper into the mindmap structure, while maintaining the option to use normal connections for any nodes using
   the default style.
