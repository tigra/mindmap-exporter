# SVG Removal Analysis

After examining the SVG content with and without the extraction, I've identified the key issues:

## The Problem

1. **Namespace issues**: When extracting inner content from the SVG, we're losing important namespace declarations (`xmlns` and `xmlns:xlink`) that are defined on the root SVG element.

2. **ViewBox transformation**: The content produced by dom-to-svg uses a large negative coordinate system (around -9998) which is transformed through the viewBox of the original SVG. When we extract just the inner content, this transformation is lost.

3. **Text positioning**: The extracted text elements have positions far outside the visible area (like x="-9988") because they rely on the viewBox transformation of the original SVG to be properly positioned.

4. **Missing attributes**: The original SVG has additional attributes like `data-stacking-context="true"` that might be important for the rendering.

## Comparing the Two Approaches

### When Checkbox is Checked (Extracting Content):
- We lose the SVG element with its crucial viewBox transformation
- The text positions remain at large negative coordinates, pushing them out of view
- The structure is preserved but the coordinate system is broken

### When Checkbox is Unchecked (Full SVG):
- The complete SVG structure is preserved
- The viewBox transformation correctly handles the negative coordinates
- All namespace declarations are intact
- The text appears correctly positioned

## Solution

There's no easy way to extract just the inner content while preserving the positioning. The dom-to-svg library creates an SVG with a specific coordinate system, and the nested SVG structure is necessary for proper rendering.

The best approach is to:

1. Keep the entire SVG element produced by dom-to-svg
2. Position it using x/y attributes on the SVG element itself
3. Avoid trying to extract inner content, as it breaks the coordinate system

For our mindmap renderer, we should follow this exact approach - keep the entire SVG element and position it by adding x/y attributes to the SVG element itself rather than trying to extract its content.

This preserves the complex structure that dom-to-svg creates while allowing us to position it within our larger SVG structure.
