  Code Analysis: Redundancies & Unnecessary Complexity

  1. Style Management System

  StyleManager.js Issues:

  - Redundant Default Style Handling: Multiple methods handle level 7+ node styles differently:
    - reset() - Attempts to copy from level 6
    - configure() - Attempts different style inheritance logic
    - setGlobalLayoutType() - Has its own logic for preserving visual properties
  - Duplicated Property Lists: The list of visual properties is duplicated in multiple places
  - Commented-out Debugging Code: Extensive commented-out console logging clutters the file
  - Error in Layout Type Validation: Uses layout !== 'classic' instead of layoutType !== 'classic'

  StyleConfiguration.js Issues:

  - Default Value Inconsistency: The background color has both active and commented-out defaults
  this.backgroundColor = options.backgroundColor || '#090909';
  //this.backgroundColor = options.backgroundColor || '#ffffff';

  2. MindmapController.js Issues:

  - Redundant Layout Configuration: Layout configurations in handleLayoutChange duplicate the same pattern for every layout type
  - Commented-out Code: Commented code in handleStyleChange() creates confusion about what's currently used
  - DOM Element Access: The controller directly accesses DOM elements like document.getElementById('style-preset') which breaks separation of concerns

  3. App.js & Controller Duplication Issues:

  - Duplicate Layout Configuration Logic: Both app.js and controller.js implement the same layout configurations
  - Style Reset Duplication: Style reset logic exists in both app.js and controller.js handleGenerate and handleLayoutChange methods

  4. Architecture Issues:

  - Complex Property Inheritance: The getEffectiveValue has a complex inheritance chain that's hard to follow:
    a. Check level style
    b. Check node overrides
    c. Recursively check parent's effective value
  - Inconsistent Layout Type Handling: Some layouts use setGlobalLayoutType() while others use configure() with similar effects
  - UI Coupling: Controllers and models directly access UI elements, breaking the MVC pattern

  5. Performance Concerns:

  - Excessive Property Copying: Multiple copying of visual properties between style configurations could impact performance
  - Deep Recursion in Style Inheritance: The parent inheritance chain can potentially be very deep, causing performance issues

  6. Specific Improvement Opportunities:

  1. Consolidate Style Inheritance: Create a single, consistent approach to handling level 7+ node styles
  2. Extract Constants: Move duplicated property lists to constants
  3. Fix Layout Type Validation: Use correct variable in type validation
  4. Clean up Debug Code: Remove or properly manage commented debugging code
  5. Improve Architectural Boundaries: Create proper interfaces between MVC components

  This analysis reveals that the style management system has grown complex with overlapping responsibilities. A more unified approach would reduce code size and improve maintainability.
