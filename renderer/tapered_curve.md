# Creating a Tapered Curve in SVG Using Filled Path

To create a curve that varies in thickness from one end to the other, use the filled path method:

## The Technique

1. Start at one edge of the curve (thick end)
2. Draw the top curve using BÃ©zier control points 
3. Line to the other end (thin end)
4. Draw back along the bottom edge
5. Close the path with Z

## Anatomy of the Example

```svg
<path d="M50,150        <!-- Start at thick end -->
         C125,50        <!-- First control point -->
           225,50       <!-- Second control point -->
           300,150      <!-- End of top curve -->
         L300,153       <!-- Line to thin end bottom -->
         C225,56        <!-- Bottom curve back -->
           125,56       <!-- with adjusted control points -->
           50,153       <!-- to thick end bottom -->
         Z"             <!-- Close path -->
      fill="#3498db"/>
```

## Key Principles

- The initial curve (M to first C) defines the centerline
- The gap between 150 and 153 at x=300 creates the thin end (3px thick)
- The gap between 150 and 153 at x=50 creates the thick end (3px thick)
- For dramatic tapering, increase the bottom y-values at the thick end
- Control points for the bottom curve can be offset vertically for smooth appearance

## Making it Dramatically Tapered

For a dramatic taper (100px thick to 40px thin):
```svg
<path d="M50,150 
         C125,50 225,50 300,150
         L300,190      <!-- 40px thick on right -->
         C225,90       <!-- Adjusted control points -->
           125,90
           50,250      <!-- 100px thick on left -->
         Z" 
      fill="#e74c3c"/>
```

The filled path method provides precise control over thickness variation by treating the curve as a shaped object rather than a stroke.
